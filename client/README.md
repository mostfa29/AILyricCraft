## Frontend Documentation

The frontend of the "LyricCraft" app is responsible for providing an interactive and user-friendly interface that allows users to input their preferences, view generated lyrics, and interact with various features of the application. This documentation provides an overview of the frontend architecture, key components, and technologies used.


### Architecture

The frontend of the "LyricCraft" app follows a component-based architecture and is built using Next.js, a React-based framework that enables server-side rendering (SSR) for enhanced performance and improved user experience.


### Technology Stack

The frontend utilizes the following technologies and libraries:

- Next.js: Next.js is a React-based framework that enables efficient server-side rendering (SSR) and provides a robust development environment for building scalable and high-performance web applications.

- React: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components and facilitates a reactive approach to building dynamic and interactive web applications.

- TypeScript: TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional type annotations. It helps catch errors and provides better tooling and code maintainability.

- HTML and CSS: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used for structuring the content and layout of the app's user interface. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is employed for styling and visual presentation, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent look and feel.


### Key Components

The frontend of the "LyricCraft" app consists of several key components that contribute to its functionality:

1. Input Form Component: This component displays the input form where users can enter their favorite rapper's name or select a predefined lyrical style. It captures user input and triggers the necessary actions upon submission.

2. Lyrics Display Component: Once the lyrics are generated by the backend, this component displays the generated lyrics in an organized and visually appealing manner. It handles the rendering and presentation of the lyrics to the user.

3. Customization Component: This component provides an interface for users to customize and edit the generated lyrics. It allows users to make changes, such as modifying specific lines, adding or removing verses, and adjusting the song structure.

4. Styling and Theming Components: These components are responsible for applying styles and themes to the app's UI elements. They ensure a visually cohesive and appealing design throughout the application.

5. Interaction and Navigation Components: These components enable user interactions within the app, such as navigation between different sections, buttons for submitting user input, and interactive elements for customization and editing.


### Key Features

The frontend of the "LyricCraft" app offers the following key features:

1. User Input: The app provides a user-friendly interface for users to input their favorite rapper's name or select from a predefined list of lyrical styles. This allows users to specify their preferences and desired lyrical style.

2. Real-time Style Matching: The backend AI microservices analyze the user's input and match it with the most relevant predefined lyrical style from the database. Users can see the matched style in real-time, providing personalized lyric generation.

3. Lyrics Generation: Leveraging AI-powered algorithms and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the app generates a set of lyrics in the matched style. This includes verses, chorus, and potential hooks, providing users with creative inspiration.

4. Customization: Users have the ability to customize and edit the generated lyrics within the app. They can modify specific lines, rearrange verses, adjust the song structure, and add their own creative elements, allowing for personalization and artistic expression.

5. Song Structure Suggestions: The app offers suggestions for organizing the lyrics into verses, chorus, and other sections, helping users create a coherent song structure. This guidance assists users in creating well-structured and engaging lyrics.

6. Rhyme and Meter Assistance: AI services assist users in maintaining rhyme schemes, syllable counting, and rhythm in the lyrics. The app provides suggestions and feedback to ensure the lyrics flow smoothly and align with the chosen lyrical style.

7. Saving and Exporting: Users can save their customized lyrics within the app, allowing them to revisit and further edit their work. They also have the option to export their lyrics in various formats for further use, such as PDF or text files.

8. Collaboration: The app provides collaboration features, allowing users to share their lyrics with other users and collaborate on songwriting projects. This enables real-time co-writing sessions and enhances the creative process for aspiring songwriters.

9. User Feedback and Ratings: The app allows users to provide feedback and ratings for the generated lyrics. This helps users refine their lyrics and receive constructive feedback from the community.

These key features collectively empower aspiring songwriters to generate personalized lyrics in their preferred style, customize them according to their artistic vision, and collaborate with others in the creative process.


### User Interface (UI) Design

The frontend of the "LyricCraft" app follows a clean and intuitive UI design to enhance the user experience. It incorporates modern design principles, including responsive layouts, visually appealing typography, and intuitive user interactions.

The UI design focuses on providing clear and concise feedback to the user, guiding them through the app's features and functionalities. Visual cues, such as animations, transitions, and tooltips, are utilized to improve the app's usability and engage users effectively.


### Development and Build Process

To develop and build the frontend of the "LyricCraft" app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from the version control system.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Use the development mode by running `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`. This will start a local development server, allowing you to preview and test the app in a development environment.
4. Make changes to the frontend code as needed, utilizing the component-based architecture and the technologies mentioned above.
5. Test the changes locally and ensure the app's functionality and UI remain intact.

1. Introduction:
The "LyricCraft" app is a specialized web application designed to assist aspiring songwriters in generating personalized lyrics inspired by various lyrical styles. This documentation provides an overview of the app's architecture, technology stack, and key features.

2. Architecture:
The "LyricCraft" app follows a client-server architecture. The frontend is built using Next.js, a React-based framework that enables server-side rendering (SSR) for optimized performance and improved user experience. The backend is developed using Django, a high-level Python web framework, to create AI microservices for efficient lyric generation and style matching.

3. Technology Stack:
- Frontend: The frontend is built using Next.js, React, and JavaScript. Next.js allows for efficient SSR, enhancing the app's responsiveness and SEO-friendliness. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used for the user interface (UI) components and interactivity.
- Backend: The backend is developed using Django, Python, and Django REST Framework (DRF). Django provides a robust and scalable foundation for building the backend logic, while DRF facilitates the creation of RESTful APIs for seamless communication between the frontend and backend.
- Database: The app uses Google Cloud's Cloud SQL, a fully managed relational database service, to store predefined lyrical styles, user data, and generated lyrics.
- AI Services: Google Cloud's AI services, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) APIs, are leveraged for style matching, lyrics generation, sentiment analysis, and other AI-related functionalities.

4. Key Features:
- User Input: The app provides a user-friendly interface for users to input their favorite rapper or select from a predefined list of styles.
- Style Matching: The backend utilizes AI microservices to match the user's input with the most relevant predefined lyrical style from the database.
- Lyrics Generation: AI-powered algorithms and NLP techniques are employed to generate a set of lyrics in the matched style, including verses, chorus, and potential hooks.
- Customization: Users can customize and edit the generated lyrics within the app, allowing for personalization and creative expression.
- Song Structure Suggestions: The app offers suggestions for song structure, providing guidance on organizing lyrics into verses, chorus, and other sections.
- Rhyme and Meter Assistance: AI services assist users in maintaining rhyme schemes, syllable counting, and rhythm in the lyrics.
- Saving, Exporting, and Sharing: Users can save their customized lyrics, export them for further use, or share them with others through social media or other platforms.

5. Deployment:
The app is deployed on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). GCP services, including Google Compute Engine and Google Kubernetes Engine, are utilized for hosting and managing the app's infrastructure, ensuring scalability and reliability.

6. Future Enhancements:
The "LyricCraft" app has potential for future enhancements, including:
- Integration with music production software or Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) to enable seamless lyric-to-song creation.
- Enhanced collaboration features to connect aspiring songwriters and facilitate real-time co-writing sessions.
- Advanced lyric analysis tools to provide insights into lyrical techniques, sentiment analysis, and genre-specific patterns.
